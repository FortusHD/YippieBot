   - ~~Add environment-specific configurations~~

3. [x] Implement proper logging and monitoring
   - Set up centralized logging
   - Add performance monitoring
   - Implement alerting for critical issues

4. [x] Implement deletion of old logs
   - Delete old log files that don't hold any useful information anymore

5. [x] Improve security
   - Audit dependencies for vulnerabilities
   - Implement proper secret management

## Documentation
